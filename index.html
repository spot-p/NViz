                <strong>Global Obesity Rate </strong> Global Obesity Rate has had a constant rise for the past many decades,  and is one of the most neglected health crises with serious implications. This rise can partly be attributed to the gradual shift of economic productivity to services from agriculture and manufacturing, and to the rise of internet since the 1990's, which have contributed to a sedentary lifestyle. But the tight correlation between calorie consumption and obesity rate, and the rising calorie intake is puzzling.
            <br>
                <strong> Alarmingly</strong> 1 in 5 adults globally are considered obese, unadjusted for population, and on average for the world population the number is about 1 in 8. Obesity has far reaching health consequences such as diabetes, hypertension, stroke, certain types of cancers and other chronic conditions.
            <br>
            <strong>There is an urgent need </strong>to develop awareness campaigns, effective control programs with necessary policy changes. Failing to address the issue would create a heavy burden on public health systems, healthcare facilities and resources in the near future.
